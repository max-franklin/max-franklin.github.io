                <h3>Camping and Hiking</h3>
                <p>
                    Anchorage has opportunities aplenty for getting outside, many of which can be done as day 
                    hikes. Most of my favorite hikes are in the front range of the Chugach, including 
                    Wolverine Peak, O'Malley Peak, and of course, the Anchorage favorite, Flat Top Mountain. 
                    Wolverine in particular is one of my favorites, with its excellent view back into its 
                    valleys on either side. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Day hikes are an awesome way to quickly get out and enjoy the sites around Anchorage, but 
                    if that's not enough, it's easy to make a weekend out of many of Anchorage's trails. One of 
                    my favorite backpacking trails is the Williwaw Lakes trail. I love it for its parallel walk 
                    beside the peaks going behind Wolverine. In fact, if you look carefully at the photo above, 
                    you can just make out the beginning of Williwaw Lakes in the valley behind and on the right.
                    If you're willing to drive a little bit, my all time favorite backpacking trips are closer 
                    to Seward, Alaska: the Carter Lake Trail, and Tonsina Point. I love them for different 
                    reasons. Carter Lake is perfect if you're looking to hike up into a mountain getaway and 
                    be surprised by a beautiful mountain lake. If you're lucky, you might also enjoy one of 
                    Alaska's rare thunderstorms while you're out there (At least, that was my experience last 
                    time)! On the other hand, Tonsina Point offers a gorgeous temperate rainforest hike followed 
                    up by a beach camping experience, and with a little luck and good timing, delicious fresh 
                    caught salmon.

                <h3>Fantasy and Sci-Fi Literature</h3>
        
                <p>
                    While I enjoy reading poetry or literary classics every now and then, what really captures 
                    my attention are titles like Neil Gaiman's <em>American Gods</em> or Tolkien's 
                    <em>The Hobbit</em>. My top 10 favorite novels are:
                </p>
        
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Ready Player One</em> - Ernest Cline</li>
                    <li><em>The Name of the Wind</em> - Patrick Rothfuss</li>
                    <li><em>Reamde</em> - Neal Stephenson</li>
                    <li><em>The Hobbit</em> - J.R.R. Tolkien</li>
                    <li><em>American Gods</em> - Neil Gaiman</li>
                    <li><em>NEXT</em> - Michael Crichton</li>
                    <li><em>Old Man's War</em> - John Scalzi</li>
                    <li><em>Ender's Game</em> - Orson Scott Card</li>
                    <li><em>Neverwhere</em> - Neil Gaiman</li>
                    <li><em>Good Omens</em> - Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchet</li>
                </ol>
        
                <p>
                    I know that some people argue Ready Player One was too crammed full of pop-culture references, 
                    but looking past that, it's a really great story with a touching spin about what life 
                    might be like in the not too distant future. Here's hoping Steven Spielberg does a good job 
                    with it in the upcoming movie! Top title aside, out of this list my most recent read was 
                    <em>American Gods</em>. I honestly wasn't sure I was going to care for the novel at first, 
                    but it's hard hitting punches and amazing finish blew me away! If you're getting through the 
                    book right now and finding it a bit slow, just wait until you get to the last part of the book, 
                    it's fantastic.

                <h3>Personal Coding Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am engaged in teaching myself full-stack web development skills. One of my projects is 
                    actually this website! I set out to build this website in part as an exercise and demonstration of my 
                    front-end web development skills. Moving forward, I hope to build websites with a large degree of 
                    interactivity and communication with a database under my administration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than this website, I am also teaching myself data visualizations skills in Python. I already have 
                    some experience with the matplotlib library, but I want to pair it with the capability of Pygal to augment 
                    display on digital devices. Furthermore, I'm learning how to use web APIs for requesting specific 
                    information to generate data visualizations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While my hands are fairly full with the above projects, I'm also interested in using a Raspberry Pi 3 for 
                    constructing an old-fashioned retro arcade! There are a variety of amazing Raspberry Pi arcade projects, 
                    and I'm very excited to start on one of my own.
