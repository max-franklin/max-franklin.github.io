                <h3>Anchorage Landfill Drone Feasibility Study</h3>
                <p>
                    With the expanding use of drones for performing services such as photography, geographic mapping, 
                    cargo transport, etc, it's not surprising that municipalities such as Anchorage, Alaska are looking for ways
                    to apply drone technology to cut costs. Working under Dr. Aaron Doston with the University of Alaska 
                    Anchorage, I had the responsibility of analyzing photogrammetric data collected by K2Dronotics to calculate
                    volume differences over weekly time frames at the Anchorage Landfill. Volume differences can be used to 
                    determine the amount of trash being deposited at the landfill, and how much cover (gravel, wood) is 
                    being laid over the trash. Furthermore, as the landfill crew compacts the trash down, a baseline rate of 
                    compaction can be determined from the volume differences, ultimately allowing for an estimate on landfill 
                    lifespan. To analyze incoming photogrammetry data, I heavily utilized the Numpy library to grid the data 
                    and perform a Reimann summation for estimating volume differences on a weekly basis. Matplotlib was used 
                    for data visualization including 3d point cloud and contour plot construction. The ultimate outcome 
                    was the demonstration of drone aerial photogrammetry as being an efficient method for producing rough 
                    estimates of landfill volume changes in timely manner.

                <h3>Subsistence Hunting Agent-Based Model</h3>
                <p>
                    As global climate change pressures caribou populations across the Arctic, increasing human development 
                    further restricts both available caribou habitat and subsistence hunting grounds. I am currently working 
                    with Dr. Martin Cenek at the University of Alaska Anchorage to understand caribou behavior dynamics 
                    through agent-based modeling (ABM), a powerful modeling technique relying on anonymous agents with restricted 
                    logical decision-making capabilities (akin to humans). The enforcement of non-omnipotence on the agents 
                    in ABMs results in agents interacting with one another in complex ways similar to how individuals interact
                    with each other in real life. Indepedent agents arive at decisions through assessing their state and 
                    situation. For caribou agents, state could be energy level and situation the quality of habitat 
                    immediately available. Agents also have the capability to adapt to changing environments through the 
                    machine-learning technique of genetic algorithms (GAs). GAs embody the concept of Darwinian evolution, with
                    agents that enjoy a greater degree of success being more likely to survive and pass on their decision 
                    making characteristics. The ultimate objective of this project is to simulate different development and 
                    climate change scenarios on the North Slope of Alaska to understand how subsistence hunting might be 
                    impacted. Currently, the project is nearing completion, with several publications currently in the works.

                <h3>Kenai River Fisheries Agent-Based Model</h3>
                <p>
                    Global climate change poses a significant threat to salmon fisheries. As streams and oceans warm, 
                    salmon mortality increases and salmon behaviors undergo shifts in an attempt to adapt. In Southeast 
                    Alaska, the impact of a warming climate has led to altered start and duration of migration timing for 
                    returning salmon species. The Kenai River may be next to experience such temporal shifts in migration 
                    timing, potentially disturbing the complex dynamics of the commercial and personal-use fisheries present 
                    there. Complicating the matter, the river has two different species of salmon returning at the same time: 
                    a large run (~ 2-6 million) of <em>Oncorhynchus nerka</em> (sockeye salmon) along with a much smaller 
                    run (~ 30,000) of <em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em> (Chinook salmon). The vastly different sizes of these
                    runs paired with their concurrency necessitates complex management decisions opening and closing the 
                    fisheries to try and maximize sockeye salmon harvest and minimize Chinook salmon by-catch. As the peak run 
                    timing of these returning salmon species shifts, social dynamics such as personal-use fishery participation 
                    and commerical fishery gear regulation will shift. To understand the net outcome of the different possible 
                    scenarios at the Kenai River, I constructed an ABM to serve as a simulation platform for conducting 
                    scenario-based studies. My work has resulted in a published masters thesis and three journal publications 
                    in collaboration with Dr. Martin Cenek. For greater detail on the matter, please refer to the publications 
                    below.
